* re-order LinxuContainerPool.releaseSystemResources so that rootfs provider logic doesn't span release bridge
* Bridge manager Release should propagate error from destroying bridge
* Combine bridge manager and bridge builder
* Bridge builder should return errors
* GC old bridges
* Move bridge manager into network folder
* finish up error handling logic in cpool
* create bridge in code rather than during container creation (consider locking vs. optimism)
* make subnetPool implement container_pool.SubnetPool
* move bridgebuilder out of main.go
* move MySubnetPool out of old/main.go
* see if we can use a Resources interface to avoid cast to LinuxContainer
