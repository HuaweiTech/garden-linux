* finish up error handling logic in cpool
* create bridge in code rather than during container creation (consider locking vs. optimism)
* make subnetPool implement container_pool.SubnetPool
* move bridgebuilder out of main.go
* consider fixing up packages (e.g. do subnet/bridge/filter need to be under 'network'?)
* see if we can use a Resources interface to avoid cast to LinuxContainer
